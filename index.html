      <p>
        Despite being a globally recognized fashion brand, Zara’s website stands out as one 
        of the least user-friendly and least visually engaging interfaces I’ve encountered. As a 
        clothing brand known for sophistication and style, its digital presence should reflect 
        those same qualities. But instead, it often feels confusing, cluttered, and unrefined.

      <h2>What Makes It “Ugly”</h2>
      <ul class="ugly-points">
        <li><strong>Poor Visual Hierarchy:</strong> The site lacks clear visual distinction between sections. The minimalist approach goes too far, making it hard to identify menus, product categories, or navigation options.</li>
        <li><strong>Confusing Navigation:</strong> Users often struggle to find basic features like filters, cart access, or size guides. The interface hides essential tools under ambiguous icons or text that isn’t immediately visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Unbalanced Layout:</strong> Some product images are cropped or arranged unevenly, leading to a disorganized appearance. The white space feels inconsistent, and the grid alignment isn’t optimized for readability.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Brand Personality:</strong> Zara’s branding in physical stores emphasizes elegance and luxury — but the website fails to carry that same tone. The typography, color scheme, and interaction design all feel generic and lack emotional impact.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How I Would Improve It</h2>
      <ul class="improve-points">
        <li><strong>Introduce a Sophisticated Color Palette:</strong> Move away from flat whites and grays toward subtle neutrals and cool tones (like soft beige, charcoal, and muted blue-gray) to evoke a calm, luxurious mood.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhance Navigation Flow:</strong> Simplify the top navigation bar and include clearly labeled menus (e.g., “Women,” “Men,” “Kids,” “New Arrivals,” “Sale”). Add a persistent search bar and visible cart icon for accessibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve Product Presentation:</strong> Use uniform image sizing and consistent spacing for cleaner grid layouts. Add hover effects for quick previews or alternate product images to enhance interactivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Typography and Readability:</strong> Choose an elegant sans-serif font with clear hierarchy — bold for headlines, lighter for descriptions. Increase line spacing and contrast for better readability.</li>
        <li><strong>Functional Enhancements:</strong> Add small quality-of-life features like:
          <ul>
            <li>A “Quick Add to Cart” button</li>
            <li>Size and availability indicators</li>
            <li>Sticky navigation when scrolling</li>
            <li>Smooth animations for a more polished experience</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
