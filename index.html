      <h2><a href="https://www.zara.com/ph/" target="_blank">Zara Website</a></h2>
      <p>
        Despite being a globally recognized fashion brand, Zara’s website stands out as one 
        of the least user-friendly and least visually engaging interfaces I’ve encountered. As a 
        clothing brand known for sophistication and style, its digital presence should reflect 
        those same qualities. But instead, it often feels confusing, cluttered, and unrefined.

      <h2>What Makes It “Ugly”</h2>
      <p class="ugly-points">The site feels visually flat because <strong>there’s not enough 
        hierarchy</strong> to guide the eye, so it becomes difficult to tell where the menus, 
        product categories, and navigation areas actually are. Even basic features 
        like filters, the cart, or size guides are <strong>hard to find</strong> since they’re tucked 
        away under vague icons or text that doesn’t stand out. The layout also feels 
        a bit off, with product images sometimes <strong>cropped strangely or placed unevenly</strong>, 
        and the <strong>spacing looks inconsistent</strong> which makes the whole grid feel messy instead 
        of clean. On top of that, the website doesn’t really capture the elegant, 
        luxurious vibe that Zara stores are known for in real life. The typography, 
        colors, and overall interaction design come off generic, so the <strong>brand personality 
        gets lost</strong> along the way.</p>

      <h2>How I Would Improve It</h2>
      <p class="improve-points">To improve the overall feel of the site, I’d introduce a 
        <strong>more refined color palette</strong> by shifting away from plain whites and grays and instead 
        using subtle neutrals and cooler tones like soft beige, charcoal, and muted blue-gray 
        to create a calm, luxurious mood. The navigation can be made clearer by <strong>simplifying 
        the top menu and labeling categories</strong> more directly, like Women, Men, Kids, New Arrivals, 
        and Sale, while keeping the <strong>search bar and cart icon visible</strong> at all times. For product 
        displays, using <strong>consistent image sizes and spacing</strong> would make the grid look cleaner, 
        and adding hover previews or alternate product images would make browsing feel more 
        interactive. Choosing a clean, elegant sans-serif font with a <strong>clear text hierarchy</strong> 
        would improve readability, along with slightly increased spacing and better contrast. 
        Lastly, small functional touches like a <strong>quick add-to-cart button</strong>, size and stock 
        indications, sticky navigation, and smoother animations would help the whole experience 
        feel more modern and effortless.</p>
